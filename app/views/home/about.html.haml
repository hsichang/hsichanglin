          Somewhere along the line I also released a solo effort titled

          The album was recorded using turntables and vinyl sources to construct a haunting, atmospheric ambient score - a counterpoint to the heavy beats and aggressive sounds the band was known for.

            Anybody who knows me knows can glean a sense of just how much I love food.  After reading Anthony Bordain's book Kitchen Confidentials and 'Heat' by Bill Buford, I was inspired to take a stab at being a chef.  Under the tutelage of chef Daniel Parilla I was inducted into the fascinating world of cooking, working the line at
