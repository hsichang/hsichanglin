          While together, we toured heavily and globally with some of my musical heroes; but our biggest honor and accomplishment has to be the collaborative record we recorded with

          &dash; the German musical pioneers who helped establish what is now known as the 'Krautrock' sound.

        %p
          Somewhere along the line I also released a solo effort titled
          = link_to 'Remains.', 'http://www.collide-scope.com/still-remains/', :target => '_blank'
          The album was recorded using turntables and vinyl sources to construct a haunting, atmospheric ambient score - a counterpoint to the heavy beats and aggressive sounds the band was known for.

            My paper documented and explored the emerging musical lexicon developing among NYC turntablists -- musicians who repurpose turntable record players as their main means of expression.
